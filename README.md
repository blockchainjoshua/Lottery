# Design Patterns for Ethereum and Hyperledger Lottery
## I. Simple Lottery
In this type of lottery the winner will be selected from all participants who bought a lottery ticket. In this type of lottery the players can only buy one ticket per transaction and there is no winning number or combination to draw to select the winner. 
### 1.1 Ethereum
 * Change the version to 4.15 from settings tab before running the smart contract.
 * Enter the time duration in seconds upon deploying the smart contract.
 * Once deployed, you can choose any account to buy a ticket worth 0.01 ether until the duration expires.
 * Five minutes after duration expires, the account who deployed the smart contract can only draw the winner.
 * The jackpot which is the total amount of the tickets from the accounts can be withdraw by the winner.
